# Who am I, anyway? A 5-minute autobiography

**In which your author divulges too much (and also not enough) personal
information in the hopes of better connecting with you, his audience**

I was born with half a heart shortly before the turn of the millennium
near Milwaukee, WI, USA, Earth. My childhood in a loving home with
loving parents and three siblings was uneventful - I spent most of my
time reading, writing fantasy books, playing with friends and with Hot
Wheels cars, and generally just imagining. We were raised Catholic, and
I went to a private school until we moved to the suburbs when I was
about 9. From there, I continued my merry life of making armor out of
pizza boxes and accidentally injuring myself. I even started playing
Minecraft.

A few years after I accidentally hit myself in the back of the head with
an axe, I became a high schooler. In between, I was hit by a major bout
of depression that plagues me to this day. I have struggled with many
episodes of suicidality, but with help from the aforementioned family,
the friends I made along the way, and caring teachers and counselors,
I've learned how to cope (and take daily anti-depressants).
Otherwise, high school continued like most school: Easy, engaging,
boring, and full of socialization.

When high school began, so did my software career. When I sat down to
learn Visual Basic, I thought I'd be typing 1s and 0s into a green
terminal - I was never more shocked than when I learned we could write
code with regular words.

After the girl I loved found someone else, your 16-year-old author
started dating someone who ended up raping him. That was not fun. We
broke up.

Before the breakup, though, I started my "volunteer career" as
a camp counselor. Turning Rivers will forever hold a special place in my
heart. The amazing work that program does for so many kids is beyond
magical. I am incredibly thankful for their presence in this world.
Unfortunately, with The Pandemic That Shall Not Be Named and my move
across the country, this "career" was paused after just a few
years.

I went through college as most other students did. My magic super brain
gave me good grades, I socialized plenty but rarely drank, I developed
PTSD from the aforementioned sexual assaults (and some not-mentioned
sexual assaults in college), I built my own apps, and I read about the
FIRE movement (though I've never identified with it). Just your
average college experience. My mom says I dated around\* but I maintain I
dated asquare. Heh. Moving on.

I knew going into college I would be a software engineer (or industrial
engineer, or maybe something else), but it took a few months to realize
I loved teaching. Education became my goal, and I'm still exploring
more ways to deliver that - with code, with articles, with guidance for
teachers and delivering my own lectures to students. This blog has
become a great first step. Thank you for reading. Throughout college I
was a math tutor, computer science teaching assistant, and coding club
leader - all of which were immensely rewarding.

\*OK, she said "I dated a lot of girls," but that doesn't
lend itself as well to my pun.

I studied abroad in France. I speak French. Kinda. It's kind of a
big deal. Kinda. But less importantly, my host mom verbally abused me
and I developed a fear of roommates that I didn't get over until I
moved to the West Coast of the United States and didn't have
roommates. Oh and I climbed a mountain a few times while I was there. In
France, that is.

I also learned some things in college. My Catholic upbringing and
awesome parents instilled a strong moral sense in me, and after some
philosophy and ethics courses I resolved to just plain not deceive
people. I think that's wrong. I'm not sure why other people do
that. It's not cool.

I tried to learn why other people do that by studying the brain -
biology, neurophysiology, psychology, sociology, all that fun stuff. No
luck, unfortunately, but I now know a bunch of cool Latin words for
brain parts. Or, well, I did. I'm sure my flash cards are somewhere
around hereâ€¦

Most important, of course, was making friends with a wonderful young
woman who was a photographer, as it turned out, and getting this great
headshot for free:

I like this shirt because it's full of equal signs. It covers my
love of math and social justice! <Emoji emoji="ðŸ¤“" />

I now live on the aforementioned Coast in or around Seattle, working for
Microsoft, rock climbing when I can, and doing my best to avoid video
games. For over a year, I've spent more on charity then I've
spent on myself - no one should starve - but this may not be
sustainable. I eat the same dish of tofu with peanut sauce and
vegetables nearly every day for some reason, and it wasn't until
February of this year that I got into AI.

In late 2021, I suffered a major mental breakdown from depression and
took two months off work to recover. During that time I developed a
renewed faith in God that I'm still exploring. I go to a Bible
study of sorts about every week with a bunch of old Catholic men
(including my dad), and I've learned a lot from them, from my
family, and from my personal studies.

Lastly, I'm honored to be a Big Brother through BBBS. I've
been matched with my Little for over 2 years now and I love playing
Magic and Minecraft, watching movies, and just talking about life with
him. He's the best.

I hope this helped you understand the person behind the words a bit
better. Remember that every article you read and interaction you have is
attached to a story - a person - just like this, except a lot different.
Isn't that amazing? I think it's pretty neat.
